Added contour mapping (allows for edge detection of the bird) and was able to gather the data in real time. Then finally it aggregates the angles and puts it into a graph as shown at the end to see the bird's orientation.

## See the linked demo: [Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14xPOeZPAvR9AlDtfifMNHUmbOj6-5AVB/view?usp=sharing)

In the real test the graph and other debugging/visualization features will be turned off to optimize the speed of data collection.

Finally, the only issues (angle number is thrown off) that occur is when the bird goes off screen but this was due to me recording this by hand and will not be an issue in the stationary apparatus in the lab. I am very hopeful for lab trials. I'll keep working on it to see if it can be improved.
