1. OpenCV Contour Detection
2. Using Dynamic Thresholding (Otsu)
3. To limit outliers, sample 10 most distant and any distance greater than 
    x away will be discarded as an outliers
    
    This extends to looking at all sorted points distances from com and if there are any gaps > threshold, 
    get rid of all points greater than that gap

4. Check shape if circular all good, if irregular try again
